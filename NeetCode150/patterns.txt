Useful Patterns I found while I am learning to LeetCode

1. Anagrams : Use count = [0]*26, use this to group anagrams of particular string. Best for:
   - Valid Anagram
   - Group Anagrams
   - Find All Anagrams in String
   - When strings have same characters in different order

2. Top K : Use Bucket = [[] for _ in range(len(array)+1)] to store frequency of items. Best for:
   - Top K Frequent Elements
   - Kth Largest Element
   - Frequency Sort
   - When you need elements based on frequency/rank

3. Two Pointers : Use left and right pointers for array problems, especially with sorted arrays. Best for:
   - Two Sum II
   - Container With Most Water
   - Trapping Rain Water
   - When array is sorted and you need to find pairs

4. Hashmap for Lookup : Use dictionary for O(1) lookups and to store frequencies. Best for:
   - Two Sum
   - Contains Duplicate
   - First Unique Character
   - When you need O(1) lookups and frequency tracking

5. String Manipulation : Use length + delimiter + string format for encoding/decoding. Best for:
   - Encode and Decode Strings
   - Serialize/Deserialize Binary Tree
   - When you need to convert complex data to string and back

6. Set Pattern : Use set() for O(1) lookups and removing duplicates. Best for:
   - Checking duplicates (Contains Duplicate)
   - Finding unique elements
   - Intersection/Union operations
   - Removing duplicates from array
